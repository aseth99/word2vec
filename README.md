# word2vec
me trying to replicate online versions of word2vec

word2vec takes in a big training set (can feed it a text file with basically unlimited lines of text) then assigns each word a vector space. Then we can use the differences between words vector spaces to see if theyre similar or not. This can be effected drastically by the data set we use to train the network.
